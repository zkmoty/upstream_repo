--------------------

Today is gonna be the day
By now you should've somehow
hsdfkjhsdkjhsdkfjhsdkfjhskfdjhsdkjfhsdkjfhskjhksdjfhskfhj
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now



That the fire in your heart is out

I'm sure you've heard it all before
jhvgddjshfgjsdhfgsjhfgjshfgjdshgfdsjhfgsjhfgsjhfgsjhfgj
But you never really had a doubt

I don't believe that anybody 

Feels the way I do about you now



And all the roads we have to walk are winding

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

There are many things that I 

Would like to say to you

But I don't know how



Because maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me

And after all

You're my wonderwall



Today was gonna be the day

But they'll never throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow

Realized what you're not to do

I don't believe that anybody

Feels the way I do

About you now



And all the roads that lead you there were winding

And all the lights that light the way are blinding

There are many things that I 

Would like to say to you

But I don't know how



I said maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me 

And after all

You're my wonderwall



I said maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me 

And after all

You're my wonderwall



Said maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me

You're gonna be the one that saves me

You're gonna be the one that saves me
