Last nite she said, oh baby I feel so down
When you turn me off, when I feel left out
So I, I turned round
Oh baby don't care no more, I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door
Well I've been in town for about fiteen whole minutes now

And baby I feel so down

And I don't know why

I've been walking for miles



People they don't understand

Your girlfriends they can't understand

Your grandsons they won't understand

On top of this I ain't ever going to understand



Last nite she said, oh baby don't feel so down

When you turn me off, when I feel left out

So I, I turned round

Oh baby going to be alright, it was a great big lie

Cause I left that night yeah



People they don't understand

Your girlfriends they don't understand

In spaceships they can't understand

And me I ain't ever going to understand



Last nite she said, oh baby don't feel so down

Well she turn me off, when I feel left out

So I, I turned round

Oh little girl I don't care no more, I know this for sure

I'm walking out that door yeah
